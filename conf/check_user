# /etc/pam.d/check_user
#  NOTE:   The current setup will only have the check_user application
#  	Check against pam_imap.so.  If you'd like to do a test run
#	with the rest of your authentication services, then uncomment
#	them in this file.  This will give a separate testing environment
# 	with pam_unix.so, or perhaps pam_krb5.so, and all your 
#	favorite friends in combination with pam_imap.  Use
#	this for testing before adding to a vital service like sshd
#	or login...   you wouldn't want to accidently lock yourself
#	out would you?   ;-)
#
#  Make the file /etc/pam.d/imap-auth look similar to your 'system-auth'
#  file, but change the auth section to use pam_imap.so.
#  Any services that direct to 'service=imap-auth' will have the same
#  functionality.
